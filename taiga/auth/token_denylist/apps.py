Denylist app
=============

This app provides token denylist functionality.

If the denylist app is detected in ``INSTALLED_APPS``, Taiga Auth will add any
generated refresh token to a list of outstanding tokens.  It will also check
that any refresh token does not appear in a denylist of tokens before it
considers it as valid.

The denylist app implements its outstanding and denylisted token lists using
two models: ``OutstandingToken`` and ``DenylistedToken``.  Model admins are
defined for both of these models.  To add a token to the denylist, find its
corresponding ``OutstandingToken`` record in the admin and use the admin again
to create a ``DenylistedToken`` record that points to the ``OutstandingToken``
record.

Alternatively, you can denylist a token by creating a ``DenylistMixin``
subclass instance and calling the instance's ``denylist`` method:

.. code-block:: python

  from rest_framework_simplejwt.tokens import RefreshToken

  token = RefreshToken(base64_encoded_token_string)
  token.denylist()

This will create unique outstanding token and denylist records for the token's
"jti" claim or whichever claim is specified by the ``JTI_CLAIM`` setting.

The denylist app also provides a management command, ``flushexpiredtokens``,
which will delete any tokens from the outstanding list and denylist that have
expired.
